            <h1>Oceans</h1>
            <p>With the Earth warming up due to climate change, the ocean levels have drastically changed and become a problem for people all around the world. It begins when glaciers and large ice sheets melt and add water into the ocean. This increases the mass of the ocean because of the change in state of matter. Some glaciers that are hundreds of years old have began to melt and increase the sea levels.</p>
        
            <h1>How does this affect humans?</h1>
            <p>Currently 2.15 billion people worldwide live near the coast so this can cause flooding and whole communities being whiped out. When the sea levels rise it is a safety risk and causes mental distress to millions of people in a time of crisis. </p>

            <h1>Connection to the land</h1>
            <p>Many different Indigenous communities have strong connections with the land and have lived off of the resources that the ocean supplies them. Northern Indigenous communities rely on the resources that come from fishing. Ice fishing is very common in winter and with the ice melting it reduces the amount of areas that people can fish safely. When the water is warmer it means that the ice is not as thick nor safe to fish on. Before colonization many Indigenous communities in Canada lived on the ice for months at a time which has not been possible with the increase in temperature. Ice fishing is part of many cultures worldwide and climate change has become a threat to the business and wellbeing of many remote communities. </p>

            <h1>Tornadoes</h1>
            <p>The way that a tornado forms is from large thunderstorms where the warm and humid air rises into the atmosphere and the cold air sinks to the surface. This causes an intense spinning motion inside the cloud that when powerful enough, can touch the Earth's surface and destroy things in its path. With climate change and increased temperatures, these natural disasters can happen more frequently as the warmth fuels the storm. In areas like Saskatchewan tornadoes are more common because the moisture from the flat soil increases the intensity. Areas that have high frequency tornadoes have been experiencing harsher storms which are more destructive. This has impacted the harvests and wellbeing of some communities as they have experienced the danger that climate change brings to natural disasters. 
            </p>
        
            <h1>Hurricanes</h1>
            <p>Most natural disasters are supposed to occur naturally but with the increase in temperature there has been changes in the intensity and frequency that these events occur. Hurricanes are natural storms which form over the ocean and move to moisture-rich areas which enhance the storm until it hits land. When it is moving through warm areas the thunderstorm activity increases. When the Earth is drastically warming up it means that these tropical storms are easily fueled and can cause lots of damage to environments and buildings. </p>
            
            <h1>Nationalism</h1>
            <p>The safety of world citizens has not been prioritized in regards to climate change. When countries do not regulate emissions and ignore causes of climate change it can cause millions of people to be displaced yearly due to natural disasters. Many different groups of people worldwide are losing their sense of nationalism from loss of culture and displacement.
