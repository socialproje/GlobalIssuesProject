            <h1>What is climate change?</h1>
            <p>Climate change refers to the shift of global temperatures over an extended period of time. This can happen naturally, through volcanic eruptions, changes in the Earth's orbit, tectonic shifts and solar flares from the sun. Although there are many different natural ways that global heat may increase, human activity has caused drastic changes in temperature in unnaturally small amounts of time. There are many causes of climate change but power generation, manufactured goods, deforestation, transportation and over-consumption all have been major contributors. Climate change can impact the smallest to largest organisms on Earth and is a threat to the existence of thousands of living things on Earth.</p>

            <h1>The Carbon Cycle</h1>
            <p>Carbon is constantly moving from the atmosphere to Earth in a continuous cycle. This is known as the carbon cycle. It explains the balance of carbon levels from the atmosphere to Earth, so with the increase in human activity which releases excessive amounts of carbon the cycle is disturbed. Along with the mass amount of carbon released the organisms which absorb carbon to put back into the Earth have been reducing in population size due to deforestation. </p>

            <h1>Heating Up</h1>
            <p>When humans release abundances of carbon into the atmosphere it gets trapped because the planet cannot process the quantity. This means that all of that carbon stays in the atmosphere and absorbs the sun's radiation. This is natural but what causes it to become a problem is when the heat cannot be released from the atmosphere and becomes trapped. Every year has set a new record for global heat temperatures which ensures scientists that this is not a coincidence and is fueled by human activity. </p>

        <section class="affectus">
            <h1>How does this affect us?</h1>
            <p>With more than 8 billion people on Earth, individuals often do not see the impact a single human being has on the planet. This can be proven false as the average person produces four tons of carbon a year. Often more developed countries such as the US, citizens can produce four times that amount. The threat of climate change startles the food chains and ecosystems while also being a threat to future and current generations. Natural disasters and illness have become more threatening worldwide which can harm the global community. Each person is responsible for their own contributions to the issue and the repercussions that face nations. </p>
        
            <h1>Nationalism</h1>
            <p>As a global community it is the job to protect and preserve the planet. It has become embedded in many different countries' policies to be aware of the carbon emissions from their own country and setting up laws which reflect their desire to prevent the consequences of climate change. Canada has participated in the Paris Agreement in pursuit of keeping the temperature rise during this century below 2Â°C. Many different nations have made it part of their national interest to work towards decreasing the risks of climate change. This has inspired nationalism in different countries which have been recognized for their efforts to reduce climate change.
            </p>
            
            <h1>Did you know...</h1>
            <p>Global emissions have risen by 12 billion tons of carbon from 2020-2022. Although some countries are working towards preventing climate change there are many nations which have people who do not believe in climate change. In 2017 a study taken in the US determined that more than 15% of US citizens do not believe in climate change.</p>
